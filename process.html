    <h1 class="display-5">Inspirations</h1>
      <p>Since the entire objective of this website was to strictly base it off bootstrap elements and components, I tried to recieve inspirations from many templates, but more specifically, successful templates that actually are visually appealing. I felt like in order to succeed, each page had to include a minimal amount of content, rather than a lot.</p>

            <p class="lead">Banners</p>
            <p>I am a big fan with viewport banners, since it allows websites to display one image of what you want your entire website to be about. In this case, since I love nature, I wanted to display some image that captures that idea, and display text and navigation.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="col-sm">
            <img src="img/profileinspiration.png" width="200px">
            <p class="lead">Profile Picture</p>
            <p>I feel like a rounded profile picture with a minimal amount of text describing the image is most effective, because it allows the users who are viewing the website to quickly understand the purpose of the page.</p>
          </div>

            <p class="lead">Navigations</p>
            <p>The navigations behind this website were made to be as simplistic as possible. Having a complicated navbar makes users think, which surprisingly is what you do NOT want. You want your users to freely be able to navigate around the website with ease.</p>

        <h1 class="display-5">Color Palette</h1>
        <img src="img/palette.png" width="800px" style="border: 1px solid black">
        <!-- Special Thanks to https://coolors.co/ffffff-000000-7a7a7a -->
        <p>I felt that having a basis for your color palette is key, and letting your images create its own environment for each page, but having simplistic colours and shades are important too. I feel like for professional websites, the 3 basic shades are typically: White, Black, and grey, as it allows for users to not get blinded by any other bright colours.
